About Me
======
This is William. I'm an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science & Statistics with a minor in Mathematics at [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). 

I have a broad interest in **networked systems** research, no matter it's wired or wireless, at the edge or in the data center, benefiting service providers or clients. I like building theoretically provable and smart heuristic solutions, but I'm also open-minded in including data-driven approaches in my research. 

At UIUC, I work closely with Prof. [Deepak Vasisht](https://deepakv.web.illinois.edu/index.html) on space networks and content delivery, and Prof. [Tianyin Xu](https://tianyin.github.io/) on cloud systems. I also collaborate with Akamai in my CDN research.

Research Experience
======
* Satellite-based CDNs (May 2024 - May 2025, with Prof. Deepak and Akamai)
  * Built a theoretically provable high-fidelity CDN traffic generator for geographically diversed traces that achieves < 1% difference in hit rate curve and requests distribution with real traces.
  * Designed and evaluated a satellite-based CDN system that can reduce current space networks' uplink usage by up to 80% and latency by 50% as compared to current space networks. 
* Cloud Management Systen Interaction (May 2024 - Present, with Prof. Tianyin)
  * Studied the interaction and failure patterns between cloud management system, operator, and applications.
  * Found 70+ new bugs with a tool implemented based on the findings in study.
* Cloud Storage System Emulator Fidelity (May 2023 - March 2024, with Prof. Tianyin) 
  * Built a fuzzing tool that identifies 94 API discrepancies between emulator and actual services.
  * Presented a detailed study on discrepancies.
